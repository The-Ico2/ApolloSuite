## Note from Ico2

This is my first time building a project of this scale, and also my first time working with React. While I’m still **extremely new** to both the tech stack and large-scale development, I’m learning rapidly and putting in the work to make ApolloSuite the best it can be.

If you have ideas, suggestions, or would like to assist in any way, feel free to contact me at **[real\_ico2@outlook.com](mailto:real_ico2@outlook.com)** — contributions, feedback, and collaboration are all welcome.
